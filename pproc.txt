This paper reports work on the automatic generation of microprocessors
to suit particular applications.  We use our own hardware compilation
system to produce synchronous hardware implementations of parallel
programs and have constructed platforms incorporating FPGA and
transputer components to host such implementations. Our chosen
language, Handel, is essentially a subset of occam with as few
extensions as  necessary to address the special nature of hardware
implementations.
The system reported here can take a Handel program and, rather than
mapping it directly to hardware, will first transform it into a custom
microprocessor, expressed as another Handel program, and a machine code
program. The hardware compiler is then invoked to construct the
resulting application-specific microprocessor. This approach may have
benefits for applications where the kernel, or `inner loop', is too
complex to be implemented as parallel hardware, but where a speed
increase beyond that possible with off-the-shelf microprocessors is
desired.
