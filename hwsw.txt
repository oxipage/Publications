Constructing Hardware-Software Systems from a Single Description
Ian Page

The study of computing is split at an early stage between the separate
branches that deal with hardware and software; there is also a
corresponding split in later professional specialisation. This paper
explores the essential unity of the two branches and attempts to point
to a common framework within which hardware-software codesigns can be
expressed as a single executable specification, reasoned about, and
transformed into implementations.  We also describe a
hardware/software co-design environment which has been built, and we
show how designs can be realised within this environment. A rapid
development cycle is achieved by using FPGAs to host the hardware
components of the system. The architecture of a hardware platform for
supporting experimental hardware/software co-designs is presented. A
particular example of a real-time video processing application built
using this design environment is also described.
