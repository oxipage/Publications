Reconfigurable Processors

An invited keynote address for the Heathrow PLD Conference, April 1995.

We believe that radical changes are set to affect many aspects of
computer architecture.  The force behind the changes is the
newly-emerging technology of dynamically reconfigurable
hardware. Dynamically Programmable Gate Array (DPGA) chips are today's
most potent implementations of such hardware. Using them, hardware can
be built in milliseconds under purely software control; they are early
embodiments of truly general-purpose hardware.

We argue that conventional microprocessors are a poor match for any
particular application, though they support a wide range of
applications quite well. We suggest that the solution is to use
additional silicon to provide hardware which can be configured to
support any application. By combining a conventional processor
with a DPGA on a single chip, commodity pricing is maintained and yet
the same part can be targetted effectively across a wide range of
applications.
