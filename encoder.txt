A case study of a `smart sensor' interface


This paper describes the experience of using our hardware compilation
technology to design and build hardware to interface a set of sensors
to the controlling computer of a robot system.  It is a common
experience that producing hardware solutions for application problems
is fraught with difficulties.  However, the progress of hardware and
software technologies are now beginning to enable completely different
ways of implementing systems. This is particularly true when hardware
components of a system are implemented by dynamically reconfigurable
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chips. In the Hardware
Compilation Research Group at Oxford, we are investigating the
automatic derivation of complete systems, including hardware and
software components, from executable specifications. We are trying to
make the implementation of hardware/software systems as much like
programming as possible, thus reducing emphasis on the difficult
issues of hardware design.  Here, we demonstrate the approach that our
group is taking to designing and implementing parallel computing
systems for time-critical applications by reference to one particular
example.
