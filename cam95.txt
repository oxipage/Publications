The Design of a New FPGA Architecture
Anthony Stansfield and Ian Page. 
A description of the new CAM-based FPGA architecture

A new Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture is described.
This architecture includes a number of novel features not found in
currently available FPGAs. It is believed to offer a significantly
improved logic density in some common applications.

This paper describes the development of the FPGA and looks at the
mapping onto it of some interesting application circuit elements. The
design is discussed in approximately chronological order which allows
us to explain other options which were considered and rejected during
the development process.
