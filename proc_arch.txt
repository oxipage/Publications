Reconfigurable Processor Architectures
Ian Page

No particular application is well-supported by a conventional
microprocessor which has a pre-determined set of functional units.
This is particularly true in highly dynamic areas, such as multimedia,
communications and other embedded systems. We suggest that additional
silicon is used to provide hardware which can be dynamically
configured to support any application. By combining a
conventional microprocessor and FPGA reconfigurable logic on one chip,
commodity pricing is maintained and yet the same part can effectively
support a wide range of applications. A novel FPGA architecture is
outlined which is particularly suitable for this style of
implementation.
