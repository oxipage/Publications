This paper reports the design and programming of a parallel processor
which is a coupled arrangement of a 256-processor SIMD machine and a
42-processor MIMD machine. Many applications, particularly in the
areas of computer graphics and vision, naturally exhibit extensive
data-parallelism in some of the key algorithms and extensive
control-parallelism in others. We have constructed a computing engine
which encompasses both a data-parallel computing paradigm in a 16 x 16
SIMD array, and also a control-parallel paradigm in a MIMD network of
transputers. The two parallel machines are closely coupled and the
SIMD machine has a video output channel for the generation of
real-time animations (with video input being added soon). The entire
system is programmed in Occam 2 which will eventually be extended to
include facilities specifically for certain array data types and
operations handled in the SIMD machine.  This system is now allowing
us to investigate dual paradigm algorithms effectively and we report
some of the early results from using this novel parallel processor for
applications in both graphics and vision.
