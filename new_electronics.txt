It has always been possible, and sometimes necessary, to create
special purpose hardware solutions to some computing problems.  The
prime motivation for doing this is when low cost, general purpose
solutions, typically using microprocessors, do not have the
performance required by the application. However the development of
such hardware solutions is not for the faint hearted.  Development
costs are usually high and timescales can be very long, making this an
unattractive option where the need for high performance does not make
it unavoidable.

However, the emergence of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips
is rapidly changing the nature of hardware implementations, since
hardware can be constructed in milliseconds by loading parametrisation
data into FPGAs.  If this hardware innovation is coupled with
high level tools for designing the hardware configurations, then it is
possible to reduce the entire hardware design to a purely software
process. Additionally, where it is possible to standardise on a
platform using a fixed number of FPGA and other VLSI components, it is
possible to render the entire hardware design and implementation
to a purely software process.

Over the last four years my Hardware Compilation Research Group in the
Computing Laboratory at Oxford University has been working to that
end, and we have developed a range of software tools and hardware
platforms which allows us to create new hardware based solutions,
sometimes in only a few hours.
