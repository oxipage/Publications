Closing the hardware/software gap by algebraic transformations of programs
(20 pages, written 13Dec93)


The study of computing science is split at an early stage between the
branches dealing separately with hardware and software; and there is a
corresponding split in later professional specialisation. This paper
explores the essential unity and overlap of the two branches. The basic
concepts are those of occam, taken as a simple example of a high-level
programming language; its notations may be translated by the laws of
programming to the machine code of a conventional machine.  Almost
identical transformations can produce the networks of gates and
flip-flops which constitute a hardware design. These insights are being
exploited in hybrid systems, implemented partly in hardware and partly
in software. A TRAM-standard printed circuit board called HARP has been
constructed for such applications. It links a transputer by shared
memory with a commercial Field Programmable Gate Array. Prospects for
application are discussed.
