Advanced Silicon Prototyping in a Reconfigurable Environment
M. Aubury, I. Page, D. Plunkett, M. Sauer, and J. Saul. 

A flow is proposed which offers a programming approach to the systems
design of application specific micro-controllers. Tools have been
developed for compilation and co-simulation, and a reconfigurable
board has been designed which can be used for rapid prototyping. The
final design can be compiled into a structural VHDL netlist for a
standard cell ASIC process.
